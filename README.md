# Overview:

In the digital age, social media platforms have become the primary medium for brands and individuals to communicate, market, and engage with their audience. Understanding the dynamics of social media interactions is crucial for optimizing content strategy and maximizing engagement. This project aims to delve deep into a dataset representing social media interactions across popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok.

 

## Dataset Description:

The dataset encompasses 10,000 rows of data from four major social media platforms. Each row represents a post and includes details such as:
- Platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok)
- Username
- Post Date
- Post Content
- Post Type (Text, Image, Video)
- Engagement Metrics (Likes, Shares, Comments)
- User Metrics (Followers, Following)
- Reach and Impressions
- Revenue generated from the post
- Video Views (for Video posts)

 

## Objectives:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution and trends of posts across different platforms, the engagement metrics, and user behaviors.
2. Engagement Analysis: Identify which type of content (Text, Image, Video) receives the most engagement.
3. Revenue Analysis: Examine the correlation between engagement metrics and revenue. Identify which platforms and post types are the most lucrative.
4. Performance Dashboard: Monitor performance within an interactive Tableau dashboard, using date range controls to examine metrics over time.

 

## Tools & Techniques:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
- Visualisation: Use charts, graphs, and heatmaps to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical tests to validate hypotheses about user engagement and content preferences.
- Machine Learning: Utilize regression models to predict engagement metrics and revenue.

 

## Outcomes:

By the end of this project, insights into the following questions will be provided:
- Which platform offers the best engagement for a particular content type?
- Which platform generates the most revenue?
- What are the average totals for reach, engagement, and revenue by platform, post type and date?

 

## Conclusion: 

Social media analysis is pivotal for brands, influencers, and marketers to tailor their strategies effectively. This project will offer a comprehensive understanding of social media dynamics, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance their online presence and profitability.
